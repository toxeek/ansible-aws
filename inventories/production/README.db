We can have multiple groups in the inventory files, say
[webservers]
..

[appservers]
...

# AWS section, declaring country groups, to pass to ec2.py dynamic inventory 
# (see ansible doc for it, we can pass regions and availability zones)

[USA]
[Europe]

# Attaching EC2 groups as children
[USA:children]
us-east-1
us-west-1

[Europe:children]
eu-west-1
eu-central-1




Then, we can point ansible to this inventory (-i) and make it linit execution to a certain group of servers, e.g:

ansible-playbook -i inventory_path/ --limit webservers playbook.yml
ansible-playbook -i inventory_path/ --limit "Europe" playbook.yml
